Does anyone else feel like they’re just not good at anything?
I’m 31(m) now, and I have NEVER felt like I thrive at anything. It’s really been killing my mental, it’s frustrating seeing others be so good at a certain something, yet I’m here, just living I guess?

My hobby is gaming, and even there the past few months I’ve noticed my (very little) skill declining like a mudslide.

I know and understand getting older things tend to dwindle, I get it. However it’s still such a buzzkill I feel like I can’t even enjoy my hobby without getting upset that I can’t keep up.

I feel like a monotonous robot, just do my daily duties, clock out at home and just…. Live? Idk if that makes sense but I am at a super dark state right now it feels like it’s killing me slowly.

Idk I’m just kinda ranting here…. But I just needed to at least write it out and go from there.
